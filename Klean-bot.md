# Klean bot manofesto

Wall free, walls are forever and litter our shard

Free borders, dont block travel of screeps and leave ramparts public

Conflict Free, there is enough energy & minerals for all of us

Preservation, unclaimed rooms will be restored to their natural beauty

Klean bot will only occupy the edge sector
Trying to keep the most remote sectors of the shard as pristine and natural as possible.

Klean bot will only expand in a clockwise direction

Reduced footprint, maintain less then 30 lvl 8 rooms at a time

To prevent over use of the land we dont plan to stay long once the land around us is restored we will move on to new lands.

Once 30 lvl 8 rooms are established the farthest back room will be abandoned and the expansion clockwise will continue.

Process power to offset energy footprint

All minerals are mined in a sustainable fashion

Humanitarian shipments of energy will be sent to nearby rooms in crisis

Use links and terminals whenever possible to reduce transport intents

All natural, organic, gluten free boosts

Give back, 10% of profits will be returned to the local community

The rooms controller will be praised to the highest level ensuring that as much energy as possible is returned to the shard.

Nuclear disarmament, nukes aren't good for anyone

Population control, use as few a creep as possible to reduce ticks for the whole shard.

Reduce room usage by staying 10% bellow GCL with a goal of 20% by GCL 38, reducing a little can save a lot.

Dont want to settle down and plant roots we want to roam the edge and see the shard.

Protesters
Portal rooms will get protesters gathering in them to protest the pollution that they create.

Kleansers
When population control measures take place at 30 rooms there will be a radical group that splits off the kleaners.

They will form a new expansion and become the kleansers.
They will be aggressive to all neighbors as the only way to save the shard is rid it of those that pollute it.
They will have a 1/5 chance of requesting minerals from kleaner base.
There is a 1/2 chance that it will be the mineral they requested.
The amount of minerals will be random.
They will sell unwanted minerals on the market for a discount.
Credits gained will be used to buy needed minerals from the market.
If you are on the enemies list of the kleaners the kleansers will be even more agressive towards you
kleansers will fly pirate flag and build upright
players that attack this room will be added to the kleaners friends list
This room will be abandoned and spawn at the front lines if it is the farthest back expansion or if there are no hostiles in range
